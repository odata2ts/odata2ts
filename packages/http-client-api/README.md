# HTTP Client API

Defines the contract between [odata2ts](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts) and any HTTP client implementation.

The responsibilities of the HTTP Client are:
- HTTP request execution
- Mapping responses to conventionalized structures
- Custom request configuration (optional)
- Automatic CSRF Token Handling (optional)

Features like **optimistic locking** (via `ETag`) or **batch requests** are currently not in scope
of the HTTP client and may never be.

## Documentation

## Tests
As this library provides the API as TypeScript types, there are no runtime
artefacts to test.

  * exercise Test Driven Development
  * bomb the place with unit tests (code coverage > 95%)
  * ensure that assumptions & understanding are correct by creating integration tests

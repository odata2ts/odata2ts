# JQuery OData Client
[odata2ts](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts) compatible odata client based on [JQuery](https://jquery.com/).

The **JQuery OData Client** serves as HTTP client for `odata2ts`.
It uses [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) to perform HTTP requests, specifically the [ajax method](https://api.jquery.com/Jquery.ajax/).

JQuery is used by this client but not installed (declared as peer dependency).
The existing JQuery instance must be provided when initializing the client.

The whole client is meant to support usage of `odata2ts` in UI5 apps, which use Jquery for HTTP communication.

## Installation

Install package `@odata2ts/jquery-odata-client` as runtime dependency:

```bash
npm install --save @odata2ts/jquery-odata-client
```

JQuery is a peer-dependency of this package, so it's not contained in or installed through this package.

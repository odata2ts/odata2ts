# OData Query Objects

Q-Objects are building blocks which are generated by [odata2ts](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts).
They are the counterpart to the typescript model interfaces and allow for complex and powerful query semantics,
renaming and type conversion.

## Spirit
This project and this module have been created and are maintained in the following spirit:

* adhere to the **OData specification** as much as possible
  * support any OData service implementation which conforms to the spec
  * allow to work around faulty implementations if possible
* stability matters
  * exercise Test Driven Development
  * bomb the place with unit tests (code coverage > 95%)
  * ensure that assumptions & understanding are correct by creating integration tests

## Inspiration

The base idea for generating and using "Query Objects" stems from [QueryDsl](http://www.querydsl.com/).
[Jooq](https://www.jooq.org/) also works this way.

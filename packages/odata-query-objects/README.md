# OData Query Objects

Q-Objects are building blocks which are generated by [odata2ts](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts).
They are the counterpart to the typescript model interfaces and allow for complex and powerful query semantics,
renaming and type conversion.

## Inspiration

The base idea for generating and using "Query Objects" stems from [QueryDsl](http://www.querydsl.com/).
[Jooq](https://www.jooq.org/) also works this way.

# odata2ts Example: Trippin

OData2ts generation example based on the publicly available [Trippin service](https://www.odata.org/odata-services/).

The Trippin service is a V4 OData service and features a variety of different types 
(enums, complex types, collections of those, collections of primitive types) and functionalities.

This repo serves as example of how to integrate `odata2ts`, but its also used internally as basis
for V4 integration tests.

# odata2ts Example: Renaming Generated Stuff (Trippin Service)

OData2ts generation example based on the publicly available [Trippin service](https://www.odata.org/odata-services/) 
to demonstrate renaming options.

This repo serves as example of how to configure `odata2ts` in regard to its renaming options.
It is also used internally as basis for integration tests.

## Renaming Options
Take a close look at the configuration options `odata2ts.config.ts` and then compare 
the generated stuff under `generated-src`.
